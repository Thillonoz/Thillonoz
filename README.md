## ðŸ“‚ My Projects

### **Group Projects**

* [**Speedometer**](https://github.com/Thillonoz/speedometer) â€“ A **Qt GUI client/server** project that demonstrates versatile communication protocols, including **TCP** (desktop), **UART** (ESP32), and **BLE** (ESP32-to-ESP32).

### **Personal Projects**

* [**Embedded Fountain**](https://github.com/Thillonoz/embeddedfountain) â€“ A fun personal project where I built a **microcontroller-controlled fountain** with various sensors and automated features. It was a hands-on opportunity to practice integrating hardware and software to create a tangible product.
